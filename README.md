# Nathan Cox Data Science
This portfolio will contain all code and projects for an Introduction to Data Science course. This semester, I will be learning a variety of data science skills and applying them to several projects. As I complete projects, they will be updated here! Check back for projects in data analysis, visualization, and modeling!
