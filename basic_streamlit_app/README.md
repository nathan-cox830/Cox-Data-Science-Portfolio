# Exploring Music Popularity by Genre and Feature

Welcome to my first data science project! This is an exploratory data analysis for the Spotify Tracks Dataset
on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset?resource=download). In this
analysis, I have built an app using Streamlit to visualize this data. In the app, you can select genre and feature,
and see how these factors change popularity, as well as learn about some new songs to listen to!

In order to run this app, download the main.py file, install any necessary packages, and run the code 
**streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py** in your terminal.
